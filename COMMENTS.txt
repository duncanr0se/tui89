- not as easy to make actual windowed TUI as first thought

- only single layout, lots of hidden logic in layout / widgets needed
  to override. Unclear model.

- failed to understand how to make scroller; interactions between
  screen / buffer / layout / widget sizes hard to fathom.

- feels like fighting the library; may be built around "modern web
  approach" but even the modern web has progressed to the box model.

- use asciimatics anyway, but just for the building blocks such as the
  screen class. Write the rest of the windowing stuff from scratch.
