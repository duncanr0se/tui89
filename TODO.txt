   - tree control
   - file open
   - file save
   - widget explorer - add "sheet select" mode then draw widget tree
     for selected widget

potential other controls / widgets:

   - split pane
   - tab pane
   - value boxes (sliders, dials)
   - context menu

Look at other toolkits, work out if there are any other controls or
widgets that could be useful.


 PRIORITIES:

*. tree control

*. widget explorer

*. event handling (delayed), input

*. File explorer - local fs, archives, s3

*. create "ports" for different backends; experiment with asciimatics,
 urwid, vanilla curses.

*. menu bar / box from command table

*. identifying usages of ALT modifier


USABILITY
=========
Support specifying accelerators for commands and displaying those
somewhere.

No longer possible to navigate in multivalue dialog.

Also if open a dialog it retains the focus after it is closed but
retains the focus so the next key event generates a "not attached"
error.

Border widgets (pretty much all widgets except viewports actually)
don't clip their contents so when space for widgets is below those
widgets minimum space requirement they overflow the container
boundaries - need drawing contexts that perform clipping.

Not sure exactly the steps to reproduce but there are circumstances
after the popup displayed by the option box is closed where it retains
the focus and key events then cause errors because the sheets in the
popup are detached.
Same issue happens in the combobox, I think.

If navigate to option box and hit 'space' to open the popup, then hit
'space' again without navigating onto the popup already, get an error
saying can't have multiple popups.

After opening and closing a dialog (such as in basic.py File -> any)
the frame ends up with no focus. Probably the focus should remain on
the menu button.

Widgets (and dialogs) should have a "value" that can be queried -
introduce a bunch of mixin types, "ValueMixin", "FocusMixin",
"LayoutMixin", "MultipleChildMixin", "SingleChildMixin",
"CommandServerMixin"...

Need proper events - key event, mouse button events, resize events,
value changed events, function events. Also event loops and handlers.

"Multivalue" dialog box in basic.py doesn't give focus to embedded
list control. Expect that "owner" is not set up properly - this works
via tab navigation but not when the list control is selected by mouse
click.

If a list control has had the focus and then lost it, the selected
child of the list control has no apparent UI change to indicate it is
the "value" of the list control (if indeed it is). Need to have a
different visual for this case, and capture the state for it.

    - owner :: default, combobox, dialog
    - role :: toplevel, shadow, border, button, buttonbox, editable,
             label, menubar, menubox, menubutton, optionbox, undefined,
	     shadow, scroll
    - state :: default, alert, info, yes/no, composite, focus,
             transient, border
    - pen :: focus, disabled, selected, default, accelerator, area_pen,
             cursor

If a button creates a dialog when the dialog is closed the focus goes
back to the default instead of to the previously focused widget. Can
fix this by having "popup" types be Frames instead of top level sheets
and having them remember their focus across invocations (at least the
main frame keeps the focus reference when other frames are created).

Combobox should skrink dialog window when items are filtered out of
the list.

Dialogs are only pseudo-modal; can't interact with other components
whilst popup is up but they are still receiving events and
running. Work out how to get values out of a dialog box in this case;
it's easy when they block. So either make them block (how?) or work
out how to deal with async results.

Text edit components should support select, cut, paste

Scroll up / down / left / right line / page commands on
viewport. Might not be too easy to do if arrows already used to
navigating between widgets... could change navigate to just use TAB
and SHIFT+TAB then could use arrow keys for scrolling.

Document how pens work. Rethink how pens work :) - the nature of pens
just sucks at the moment. Or perhaps it's just the way popups have
been set up that sucks, I'm not sure [most pen issues are related to
trying to force specific colours on widgets that are not in a common
hierarchy with other widgets that they need to share a colour scheme
with. Usually this happens between "some widget" and "some popup menu
created from that widget"]

Accelerators - if transient window is open and accelerator is used
that is not mapped in that transient window, then the main frame
should be queried to see if the accelerator exists. If it does the
transient should be closed and the accelerator widget activated
instead.  - OR - Alternatively - disable other accelerators if popup
is on screen. This might not be efficient. *MAYBE* this "rule" should
only be applied to popup transients, not dialogs? Hrm.

Adding accelerators for 0-9 would add another 10 but would need a
different way to display them. If taking this approach could also use
$%^&* etc. as accelerators...

Allow commands to have key presses assigned for accelerators and
mnemonics; no need to select an accelerator for a command with a
mnemonic (although might still want to).

When placing a transient window on screen (dialog / popup) the current
focus should be cached and focus returned to it when the transient
window is closed.
As part of the focus handling changes, need to properly implement
graft / attach / detach along with events or NOTE-* methods.


LAYOUT IMPROVEMENTS
===================
TEXT ALIGNMENT and truncation ON BORDER TITLES

Move drawing ops to use LTRB regions where appropriate instead of
separate coord + width, height.

Could use a tool that displays selected widgets in a layout that can
have its size set, and see how different sized containers allocate and
render different widget types - add a "samples" folder and stick a few
sample apps in it.

Draw dirty sheets starting at the bottom of the z-order so that alerts
are not overdrawn by text entry boxes, for example.

Alert boxes need to do something more sensible with their size /
showing long messages.

Leaving select page up / down in text box so the issues with dialogs
can be easily reproduced.

VISUAL FEEDBACK
===============
Popup windows should be implemented as separate frames rather than as
special top-level sheet types. Maybe.

When moving up / down lines in text area if move from longer line to
shorter line to empty line, cursor is drawn at negative offset when
reach empty line - add "max(insertion_point|text_offset, 0)"
somewhere. THIS NO LONGER APPEARS TO HAPPEN; KEEP TRYING TO
REPRODUCE. It definitely still happens. Issue occurs if move up or
down from a long line that is scrolled to the right; the cursor is
drawn at the scroll origin, not taking into account the current
offset.

If list control contains decorated buttons the button just being
scrolled out of view at the top is not rendering properly.

Slug + offset calculations mean that the slug is drawn up against
scrollbar buttons when there is still movement range. Clicking
scrollbar buttons successfully scrolls remaining range, but visual
does not reflect it.

Possibly calculate slug size using a smaller bar and save offset=0 and
offset=max for extreme ends of scroll range?

Not clear how to return values from dialogs or popups. For now expect
to do this via some callback.

Should the multivalue dialog popup but then not steal focus? It makes
it difficult to use it as a component of some control... might be good
to have a popup type where the events are all still sent to the
original top-level. Think about how this should work.

What's the key event handling story for dialogs / menu boxes? If they
are owned, should probably be the same as for other widgets. Otherwise
frame needs to deal with them.

EVENTS - need to formalise what events occur and how to set up event
handlers for them.


List Control
============

Currently focused item scrolls into view if outside current visible
range, but only works currently when list control is responsible for
managing focus change, in its cycle previous / cycle next
methods. Global focus changes (via TAB navigation) do not yet move new
focus into view.

scroll extents not quite right and might be easier to debug in list
control than in general viewport.

Most of the keyboard navigation in the listcontrol should be moved to
the listlayout. Then they would also work in button boxes etc. Might
also want to move a bunch off the menu box, if the listlayout
implements them. Look at hierarchy and work out where the command
tables need to be. ACTUALLY - should NOT be on listlayout because if
used at the top level just to lay things out in a column the nav
should not work the way it works when its used as an embedded widget.

Identify which other sheet types should be controls - tab navigation
won't work within them, but arrows / ctrl-n / ctrl-p should still
work. Potential candidates: menuboxes, buttonboxes? [YES!]

If embedded list layout contains decorated buttons when scrolled off
top of list the drop shadow is not drawn properly.


GENERAL / CODING
================
DIFFERENT TYPES OF BORDERS

Use Python's "hasattr()" instead of testing if val is None where
pertinent.

Should button box have similar motion commands to list controls / menu
boxes? [YES!]

Add some error types:

  - NotAttachedError

Add region.py file to geometry to put common region methods in?

DOCUMENTATION - write some (more)

USE THE SHEET TYPES ALREADY PRESENT TO BUILD CONTROLS OUT OF; E.G.,
SCROLLBAR BUTTONS SHOULD BE BUTTONS, PADDING SHOULD BE BORDER PANE,
ETC.
In order to implement this for scroll bar buttons at least, the button
labels must be able to shrink to 1x1

Unit tests, documentation, project setup.

Migrate everything that displays text into having a contained Label
that holds the text instead.

If label shrinks too much it gives up trying to display in a reduced
space. Should either prevent resize below the minimum space, or allow
the label to shrink to nothing.


EVENT HANDLING
==============
event handling (button click / release) seems slow. Investigate.

click detection is really ropey. Maybe asciimatics is not reporting
them like it should?

Implement a "functional event" that allows functions to be called at a
later point in time, after the current event is dealt with.

Can the widgets be based on urwid instead of asciimatics? Not sure if
that will make a difference to anything, might be worth trying.

Change "find_next_focus" and "find_prev_focus" methods so they wrap
instead of stopping at end of sheet hierarchy.


===============================================

EXAMPLE WIDGET APP - MAKE IT SHOW ALL THE OPTIONS FOR ALL THE WIDGETS.

TIDY THE WIDGETS, DOCUMENT THE PROTOCOLS.

EVENT HANDLING - HOW MUCH IS NEEDED?
  - on_click
  - on_double_click
  - on_activate
  - focus_in
  - focus_out

Key events go to frame, then frame focus, and ascend to parents and
finally back to the frame. Maybe should go to focus directly first?

Focus is chosen one of 3 ways:

   1. highest z-order widget that accepts focus on initial walk
   2. mouse click on widget that accepts focus
   3. keyboard navigation to widget that accepts focus

Is "focus widget" different to "selected widget"? Is it possible to
tab to a widget that does NOT accept focus? Probably not... "selected"
and "focused" are the same thing.

Is "pressed" feedback needed? Maybe but can be subtler than it is
currently.

================================================

1. EVENT -> FRAME -> FRAME-FOCUS

2. FRAME-FOCUS is either a WIDGET or a CONTROL

3. If WIDGET, invoke handle_key_event on WIDGET.

4. If CONTROL, invoke handle_key_event on CONTROL WIDGET-FOCUS.

5. WIDGET-FOCUS is either a WIDGET or a CONTROL

4. If CONTROL, invoke handle_key_event on CONTROL WIDGET-FOCUS.

...

Steps 4 and 5 repeat until something handles the key event or there
are no more widgets / controls to pass the event through.

Identify CONTROLS because they have a WIDGET-FOCUS.

Controls can nest. When setting focus on a widget, it is set either as
the WIDGET-FOCUS for its OWNER and the OWNER is set as the FOCUS for
its OWNER in turn, or directly on the frame (that is the OWNER for
vanilla WIDGETS).

A FRAME can have a single FOCUS; a CONTROL can have a single
WIDGET-FOCUS, although many widgets within a control may be rendered
AS THOUGH they are the focus.

SETTING FOCUS also needs to walk through all the OWNERS until reaches
the FRAME. Each owner in turn is set as the focus of its owner and so
on.

Controls MUST have an OWNER, or the OWNER is the FRAME. What about
DIALOGS? Just another CONTROL I think.

Key events start at the frame and travel UP the sheet hierarchy from
lowest sheet to highest -- OR -- start at frame then go to highest
sheet and travel DOWN the sheet hierarchy.

Pass to focus then to focus then to focus until no focus, then chase
owners back down the hierarchy until end up back at the sheet.
